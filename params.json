  "tagline": "This project is an implementation of the game Othello with the help of alpha-beta pruning used as Adversarial searching. Here in this project we are basically finding the value from the current node to terminal node by traversing the whole tree using look ahead Depth First Search .Compare heuristic value with certain  value depending on its stability and mobility etc . Then we are backtracking upwards and finding the best path from current to terminal node using alpha-beta pruning. When the tree size is very large  then it is enough for any machine to hang. That’s why in future I want to implement it using Reinforcement learning. It is based on the simple concept “I can’t exploit until I explore”. But for this game this process is still good. In many college technical festival this game has been used as a event and it is still unbeatable . Because i think that it is quiet impossible to give 100 % accurate simultaneous moves by a human.",
  "body": "### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
