      <h2 class="project-tagline">This project is an implementation of the game Othello with the help of alpha-beta pruning used as Adversarial searching. Here in this project we are basically finding the value from the current node to terminal node by traversing the whole tree using look ahead Depth First Search .Compare heuristic value with certain  value depending on its stability and mobility etc . Then we are backtracking upwards and finding the best path from current to terminal node using alpha-beta pruning. When the tree size is very large  then it is enough for any machine to hang. That’s why in future I want to implement it using Reinforcement learning. It is based on the simple concept “I can’t exploit until I explore”. But for this game this process is still good. In many college technical festival this game has been used as a event and it is still unbeatable . Because i think that it is quiet impossible to give 100 % accurate simultaneous moves by a human.</h2>
